<p>Steeltoe Management Tasks provide a means of running administrative tasks for ASP.NET Core applications with the same context as the running version of your application. The original use case for this feature is managing database migrations with a bound database service on Cloud Foundry, but the framework is extensible for you to create your own tasks.</p>
